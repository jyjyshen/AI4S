#Intro to python

##The python interface
Use Python script
script.py 

##When can python be used?
Can be used for almost anything including quick calculations, for new businesses to develop a database-driven website, clean and analyse the results of a survey

##How to input comments?
Add # before the line eg #addition

##How to use python as a calulator?

Addition:
print (4+5)

Subtraction:
print (10-3)

Multiplication
print(3 * 5)

Division
print(10 / 2)

Modulus aka remainder after you divide
print(18 % 7)

Exponential
print(4 ** 2)

##What is a variable?
Variable allows one to refer to a value with a name 
eg. x=5

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings * growth_multiplier **7

# Print out result
print (result)

##What are the variable types?
-int: a number without a fractional part.
-float: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point.
-str: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
-bool: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).

# Create a variable desc
desc="compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable=True

##Checking variable types
In [1]:
type(a)
Out[1]:
float
In [2]:
type(b)
Out[2]:
str
In [3]:
type(c)
Out[3]:
bool

##Operations with other types

savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1=growth_multiplier*savings

# Print the type of year1
print (type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc=desc+desc

# Print out doubledesc
print (doubledesc)

##Type conversion

# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
savings_string=str(savings)
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7
result_string= str(result)

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + savings_string + " and now have $" + result_string + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float=float(pi_string)
